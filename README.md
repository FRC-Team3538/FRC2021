# RoboJackets FRC3538 2021 Source Code Repository

We built two robots this year: Grasshopper and Firefly. Grasshopper is a six wheel diffy-drive base with a vacuum system to increase down-force / traction. Firefly is a swerve-base with an intake, indexer, and shooter with adjustable hood. Each robot's code is stored with a git tag `grasshopper-final-irah` & `firefly-final-irah`.

Some notable features are: 
* Simulation support
* Trajectory following
* Universal gamepad class (xbox, ps4, stadia)
